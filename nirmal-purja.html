In 2012 while he was on his holidays from his daily service of the British Army, he made a plan to have a trek to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Everest Base Camp</a> (EBC).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/2/11/Nimsdai%20first%20ascent%20to%20Dhaulagiri%20with%20his%20Gurkha%20mates-1613046982244.jpg><p>In <strong>2014</strong>, he and his team of Gurkha successfully summited his first ascent to Dhaulagiri.

After retiring from British Army in<strong> 2018</strong>, a fearless Gurkha soldier with the courage to conquer the high mountains<strong> </strong>returns to Nepal.&nbsp;</p><p>A Nepalese record-breaking mountaineer was on his way to summit the first six mountains above 8000m. namely; <strong>Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Kanchenjunga, Mount Everest, Lhotse</strong>,<strong> </strong>and<strong> Makalu</strong>. After successfully climbing these six mountains, he climbed<strong> Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I (G1), Gasherbrum II (G2), K2</strong>,<strong> </strong>and<strong> Broad Peak of Pakistan</strong>. He didn't stop himself there and later on, he stands on the top of <strong>Cho Oyu, Manaslu</strong>,<strong> </strong>and<strong> Shishapangma</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/2/11/Nimsdai%20Conquering%20the%20Mountains-1613047085145.jpg><p>After putting his feet on the top of the 14 tallest mountains above 8000m he found his true calling and hence within 6 months and 6 days, he broke the record of climbing those mountains formerly set by Polish Climber<strong> </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Jerzy Kukuczka</a><strong> </strong>in 8 years duration.</p><h2>Mission Impossible!</h2><p>The beautiful tall snow-covered mountains may look amazing in a scene but they are deadly in the reality.

Cold weather, harsh environment, weather changes, insufficient training, and unknown path can simply grant a death in the high mountains.&nbsp;</p><p>A hero in the death zone, Nimsdai and his team were on the way to the summit 'Mount K2' during winter in January 2021. Before this, many mountaineers tried to climb Mount K2 during winter, many of them get lost in the arms of the mountains and many of them return with unhappy faces.</p><p><strong>Watch: Nepalese Team at the Summit of K2</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Purja and his team successfully summited <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mount K2</a> during the winter season on <strong>January 16, 2021</strong>.
