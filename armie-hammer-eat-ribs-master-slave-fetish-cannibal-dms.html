which were allegedly revealed in a series of <a href=#>NSFW messages</a> by anonymous Instagram user, <a href=#>House of Effie</a>.</p><p>Since the screenshots of <a href=#>Armie’s</a> private DMs detailing a fetish for “cannibalism” and “drinking blood” emerged, a number of women have come forward to claim the texts are really from the actor.</p><p>Speaking to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>, Armie’s ex Courtney alleged that he told her he wanted to “break and eat her ribs."</p><p>She told the publication: “He was really into saying he wants to break one of your ribs and eat it. Like barbecue it and eat it.</p><p>“In terms of the BDSM stuff, he made that pretty clear that it is something he is interested in very early on in the relationship and he referenced breaking my ribs often.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000468893292-12.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000630146953-11.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000630146952-12.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/b83502ea-e3b0-4ce5-aebd-fdc11e36232b.jpg><p>Courtney also shared a letter with the Mail and alleged that Hammer wrote, signed, and dropped off with her apartment concierge during their relationship.</p><p>It reads: “I am going to bite the F*** out of you.”</p><p>The 30-year-old also claimed that <a href=#>Armie</a> had a “master and slave” fetish that he made clear to her from the start of their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “He was very much into saying “slave” and “you're just there for me at my discretion,” – of course I wasn't doing that, but he does like that idea of somebody being there solely for him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000630153596-11.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000630279113-7.jpg><p>Courtney alleged that she felt as if she had been groomed by the actor and needed to undertake a 30-day intensive course of therapy for trauma and PTSD to deal with the repercussions after their breakup in early October.</p><p>“I was being groomed and brilliantly manipulated to do things that frankly scared me,” she claimed</p><p>“I'm a consenting adult but it wasn't me. He is good at what he does and knows just what to say to get you to comply. He is a very dark, twisted person.”</p><p>She also told <a href=#>PageSix </a>that at the time, she thought: "'f*** that was weird,’ but you never think about it again."</p><p>Courtney added: “He says, ‘I want to take a bite out of you.’ If I had a little cut on my hand, he’d like suck it or lick it.
