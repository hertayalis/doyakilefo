Lil Nas X's many siblings helped him on the path to fame.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If you haven't heard "Old Town Road" or its many remixes, you may have missed 2018 entirely. Singer and Twitter star <a href=#>Lil Nas X</a> quickly climbed to the top of every musical chart you can think of thanks to his hit single — and he's just getting started. But did you know about his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">siblings</a>? Several of his siblings had a big hand in supporting him on his way to fame.&nbsp;</p><p>Before his song was the Billboard longest running number one track of all time, Lil Nas X (given name: Montero Lamar Hill) was navigating a turbulent childhood. His parents divorced at age 6, and he was raised by his mother and grandmother for three years. After this time, Lil Nas X moved in with his father and little brother west of Atlanta.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In regard to his parents, Lil Nas X stated in an i<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nterview</a> that he rarely speaks to his mother, and hasn't since "Old Town Road" came out. His free time was mostly spent alone, which is how he grew to popularity on the internet, making friends and posting memes to Twitter.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Lil Nas X have siblings?</h2><p>Around the time Lil Nas X publicly came out in 2019, he began to mention more of his siblings and their support from him. He stated in a different interview that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">came out to his father and sister first</a>, after initially worrying that coming out would hurt his career. Later in June, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he tweeted</a> about life before fame, including sleeping on his sister's floor.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>wow man last year i was sleeping on my sisters floor, had no money, struggling to get plays on my music, suffering from daily headaches, now i’m gay.</p>— nope (@LilNasX) <a href=#>July 28, 2019</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Lil Nas X appears to have two full brothers, Lamarco Hill and Tramon Hill, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Familytron</a>. Half-siblings from his mom's side include Shaquisha Hill and Bianca Hill; and half-siblings from his father's side are Robert Sleepy, Ashley Stafford, and Labrock Anderson.</p><p>While not too many details about Lil Nas X's siblings haven't been revealed to the public, it's safe to say that he's had their support from the get go in all of life's important matters, including coming out to the public on Twitter and needing a place to shelter at his lowest points.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lil Nas X based his name on a fellow rapper, but are they actually related?</h2><p>Around the time "Old Town Road" was becoming famous, a lot of people were wondering if Lil Nas X and rapper Nas (given name: Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones) were actually related. There was even a rumor going around that Nas disapproved of the younger rapper's moniker.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Nas and Lil Nas X are not related, although Lil Nas X chose his rap moniker as a tribute to the original. However, Nas did offer Lil Nas X some words of wisdom especially after their collaboration on the remix of Lil Nas X's song "Rodeo." The established rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave Lil Nas X the advice</a> to "keep your foot on their necks," powerful and motivating words of wisdom.</p><p>Ultimately, it looks like there's still a lot we don't know about Lil Nas X's family. As he hints at the release of new music (his new single "Holiday" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just released in November 2020</a>), we are assured that wherever they are, his family is proud of him and they continue to support his superstar musical career.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobatec2aqmawXai2o7jIp56s</p></div><div id=links><a href=./show.html>&#171;&nbsp;Media Centers Everywhere with Media Center Extenders</a>
