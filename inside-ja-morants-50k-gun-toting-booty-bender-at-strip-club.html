All-Star point guard Ja Morant dribbled and drooled over a stripper at the same Denver-area jiggle joint where he blew $50,000 in tips — and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">flashed a gun</a> 48 hours later — shocking photos obtained by The Post and insiders reveal.</p><p>The new March 2 snaps show the bad-boy baller at <a href=#>raunchy Shotgun Willie’s</a> in Glendale, Colo., transfixed by the backboard of a G-string-clad brunette straddling his lap inside in the VIP room — and almost every inch of surface covered in cash.</p><p>“The whole room is full of money — it’s literally a pile. You’d need a rake,” according to one club insider who witnessed the eye-popping hardwood scene.</p><p>The vaunted 23-year-old point guard, who re-signed with the Grizzlies last year in a five-year extension deal that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">could be worth up to $231 million</a>, shelled out at least $50,000 in cash tips in the two-night booty bender, two employees told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ja Morant getting a lap dance in Colorado. <span class=credit>NY Post</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The basketball superstar enjoyed a VIP experience at the jiggle joint.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Grizzlies announced hours after the social media debacle that Morant would miss two games. <span class=credit>NY Post</span></figure><p>“That took forever to count,” a dancer recalled her colleague saying.&nbsp;</p><p>The club insider said Morant arrived at Shotgun Willie’s with a friend and two security guards around 1:30 a.m., just hours after the Grizzlies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mauled the Rockets</a> in Houston, 113-99.</p><p>Eighty minutes after the team’s plane <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">touched down</a> in Denver, the Memphis hotshot slinked in through the back of the club to enter the VIP room, where he sank at least $900 to book the space for three hours, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">per rates on the club’s website</a>, sources said.</p><p>“He was there to party, he wanted some girls in the room,” the insider said. “The music was very, very gangster.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Morant made his first showing at the club just hours after the Grizzlies mauled the Rockets in Houston. <span class=credit>Twitter @ShotgunWillies</span></figure><p>At the club, the Grizzly turned horndog, paying for four dancers and bottle service, and chowing down on a jersey-busting spread of food that appeared to include a basket of hickory-smoked wings, two platters of chicken strips and fries, and a steak, according to the insider and photos.</p><p>“That’s a little excessive, but usually excessiveness is happening all the time,” the insider quipped.</p><p>Two days later, Morant rebounded. After Memphis got trounced 113-97 in Denver, with Morant racking up 23 points, he made a fast break back to Shotgun Willie’s in the wee hours of Saturday, March 4.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">The Instagram misfire was the latest off-court antic plaguing Morant’s meteoric rise in the NBA. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>This time he broadcast himself on Instagram Live as he dangled a gun and belted the lyrics to “Bring ‘Em Out” by the rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again.</p><p>Deborah Dunafon, the majority owner of Shotgun Willie’s, confirmed Morant was a repeat customer on March 2 and 4.</p><p>“This kid, real young, was exceptionally respectful, and sweet and he did not drink [on his second visit],” said Dunafon, 72. “We’ve had [Denver] Nuggets and Broncos … come in and pitch quarters at the girls, be disrespectful and nasty. He’s marvelous.”</p><p>The gun, however, “absolutely terrified” Shotgun girls in the back room, claimed one dancer who wasn’t in the VIP room but heard complaints from her co-workers.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Morant spent $50,000 in cash tips in the two-night booty bender. <span class=credit>NBAE via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“He pulled the white boy excuse card: ‘I’m just going through a lot right now, so I’m going to act [like] a fool and put other people’s lives at risk,’” she said.</p><p>Dunafon said she and police reviewed the security footage from Morant’s now-infamous second night, and claimed “nobody saw a gun.”</p><p>And Glendale police said they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">investigated Morant</a> but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">determined</a> that there was not enough evidence to charge him with a crime.</p><p>Yet following the public firestorm over the gun livestream, Morant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">apologized</a> to his team and the public for his actions.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ja Morant had livestreamed himself flashing a gun in the club’s VIP room. <span class=credit>Twitter DJ Akademiks @Akademiks</span></figure><p>The Grizzlies announced hours after the social media debacle that Morant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would miss two games</a>, which was later extended to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">include an additional four games</a>. The NBA is investigating Morant and could hit him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with a lengthy suspension</a> if it finds he was carrying a firearm on team premises.</p><p>“Our investigation is ongoing,” said NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said Saturday.</p><p>The Instagram misfire is the latest in a string of troubling off-court antics to plague the two-time All-Star’s meteoric rise in the league.&nbsp;</p><p>Days before the gun incident, Morant was the subject of a Washington Post report on two violent incidents he was allegedly involved in last summer.</p><p>A 17-year-old filed a lawsuit against Morant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after he and a friend allegedly</a> pummeled the teen over a dozen times during a pickup game last July before the hotshot went inside and returned with a gun visible in his waistband.</p><p>Morant told a detective that the teen had first chucked a ball at his head, so he was acting in self-defense.</p><p>“I swung first,” Morant told law enforcement, adding, “The ball was to me the first hit.”</p><p>Also in July, Morant was also accused of threatening the head of security at a Memphis mall.</p><p>Morant’s agent, Jim Tanner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> the Washington Post that the allegations were “unsubstantiated rumors and gossip.”</p><p>In February, the NBA <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">investigated allegations</a> by the Indiana Pacers that Morant’s crew “aggressively confronted” members of the team’s traveling party and aimed a red laser at them, which they believed could have been attached to a gun.</p><p>The league could not confirm any evidence that the Morant’s associates had threatened anyone with a weapon. Morant’s best friend, Davonte Pack, who was involved in the conflict, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was banned</a> from the Grizzlies’ FedExForum for the rest of the season.</p><p>Morant’s agent and lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. The Grizzlies did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmamlfnru0tcOeZKOZXaK8s63NrapmbWCgeqjBzWarqKyZo7Rurs6oq7Jlkpq7pbHRZpitZaOpv6q8jJyjrppf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./safe.html>&#171;&nbsp;Safe (Movie) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</a>
